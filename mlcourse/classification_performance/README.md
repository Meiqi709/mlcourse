# Assessing classification performance

This [example](test_classification_performance.py) trains and evaluates a classifier on the MNIST handwritten digits dataset.

First, the model is trained on a binary classification task: recognize if a image contains a '5' or not.

Subsequently, another model is trained on a multiclass classification task: recognize each digit.
