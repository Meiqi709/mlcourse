# Predict heart disease

This [example](test_predict_heart_disease.py) trains a [classifier](https://scikit-learn.org/dev/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.SGDClassifier.html) to predict the existence of an heart disease (a binary classification task).

It is directly inspired by the [project workflow](../project_workflow/) and [classification performance](../classification_performance/) examples.
