# Essential tools

The goal of this lab is to get familiar with three essential libraries of the Python ecosystem for Machine Learning: [NumPy](https://numpy.org), [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org) and [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org).

The following tutorials will give you the first level of knowledge you need to start using these tools in your projects.

- [NumPy: the absolute basics for beginners](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/absolute_beginners.html)
- [10 minutes (or maybe a bit more ðŸ˜Š) to pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/10min.html)
  > If you're time-constrained, you may skip the following parts: *Selection*, *Merge*, *Grouping*, *Reshaping* and *Time Series*.
- [Getting Started with scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/getting_started.html)

If you have already used NumPy, you may follow the pandas and scikit-learn tutorials first.

> It is essential to test all code examples while studying these tutorials. The easiest way to obtain a working Python environement is by using a [Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org/) execution platform like [Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/), [Paperspace](https://www.paperspace.com/notebooks) or [Kaggle Notebooks](https://www.kaggle.com/code).

When done with the tutorials, take [this test](https://app.wooclap.com/IMLJFN?from=event-page) to check your new knowledge.
