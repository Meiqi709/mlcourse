# Introduction to PyTorch

The goal of this lab is to get familiar with [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/), a deep learning library and platform used by many developers and researchers worldwide.

## Step 1: follow a tutorial

The easiest way to discover PyTorch is by following a tutorial. The official website has two flavours of it, [with](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/introyt.html) or [without](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/basics/intro.html) a companion video series. The covered content is almost identical in both cases, so choose the one that best suits your learning habits!

> It is essential to test all code examples while studying any of these tutorials. The easiest way to obtain a working Python environement is by using a [Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org/) execution platform like [Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/), [Paperspace](https://www.paperspace.com/notebooks) or [Kaggle Notebooks](https://www.kaggle.com/code).

## Step 2: study some code examples

You should now be able to understand some simple PyTorch code. Put this new skill to the test by studying these [examples](../../mlcourse/pytorch_intro/README.md).
