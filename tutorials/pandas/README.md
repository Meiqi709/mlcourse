# Pandas Tutorial

This tutorial teaches you the very basics of [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org). Its complete source code is available [here](test_pandas.py).

## What pandas is

The **pandas** library is dedicated to data analysis and manipulation in Python. It greatly facilitates loading, exploring and processing tabular data files.

## How to import pandas

After [installing pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/getting_started/index.html), it may be imported into Python code like this.

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
```

## Basic data structures in pandas

The primary data structures in pandas are implemented as two classes:

- [Series](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.Series.html#pandas.Series), which represents a single data column: one-dimensional labeled array holding values of any type.
- [DataFrame](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.html#pandas.DataFrame), which is quite similar to as a relational data table, with rows and named columns. A `DataFrame` contains one or more `Series`. The `DataFrame` is a commonly used abstraction for data manipulation.
